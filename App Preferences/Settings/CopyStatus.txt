This file is used to let Novus know if the App Preferences\Explorer\Explorer Folders Template folder has been copied to your Documents\Novus folder. 
Do not touch anything in here, unless you want to reset your Documents\Novus completely, then set "true;" to "false;" and restart Novus, which will reset the folder completely.

copiedTemplateFolder = false;
