## Contribute
You're already here, at our repository! You can clone it and make changes over at our `suggestions` branch and we'd love to check out what you have to bring to the table for Novus! 

### Compiler
We're using the GCC Compiler for this. To download it, get [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). Once installed open **MSYS2 MINGW64** and run the following command:
```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
```

Wait for installation to run and GCC is ready to compile.

## Download
Check out [novus.zekkie.dev](https://novus.zekkie.dev/downloads) to download beta and official releases.

Novus is available for Windows *(.exe)*, macOS *(.app)* and Linux *(.deb, .rpm & .appimage)*, with Android support planned for the future (for tablets).

### Updates
Novus has a built-in auto-updater that'll check GitHub every launch to let you know if there's a new version available. 

Last update: dd/mm/yy. Check the [releases](https://github.com/zekticezy/novus/releases/) for patch notes and more info.

## Support Development
Novus was built by me **solo**, and I want my creation to be **free**, **forever**. So, if you're interested, you can support me, my family and development by [donating here](). You don't have to, but it's be really awesome if you did! 

Donators also get featured under `Settings > Credits` in-app!

## Translations
We want Novus to be available in multiple languages across the world so others can enjoy the software. If you're interested in helping, fork the repo, check out the `lang` folder and get started by reading `translation guide.txt`!
